## Overview
This is a sample project which tests the end-to-end functionality of a fully fledged Hyperledger Fabric network.
This projects demonstrates: network creation, org enrollment, certificate assignment, channel creation, ledger query/updates via chaincode, and more...

I use the Node SDK (Java is also available).
Chaincode is written in Go.
CouchDB for ledger state.
